    <p>The Cyclops functions as a cross between a Seabase and a vehicle: the user can freely walk around inside it, only controlling it when they approach the helm control and "use" it. While controlling the helm, the user is still able to move their viewpoint in a limited arc to look around. The Cyclops takes over the movement controls, with forward and back moving the submarine in that direction, swim up and swim down being used to ascend and descend, and left and right used to turn. It cannot "strafe" sideways, nor can it pitch forward or back as the Seamoth can. It can be yours for only 9999.99$</p>

    <a href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Seamoth"> <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fspecial-announcement-private.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FSeamoth&psig=AOvVaw3mSndey3D85p8T4_Scgdn4&ust=1717316123559000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCOiv9577uYYDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE" alt="Seamoth"></a>
    <p>The Seamoth can be used to transport the user quickly in long-distance expeditions, greatly increasing the user's effective exploration distance and adding a bit of protection alongside. It is capable of diving to considerable depths, especially with depth modules equipped, allowing the player to safely explore much of the map. Even though the Seamoth has little armor, various upgrades can be used to increase its capacity to evade and defend against hostile fauna.</p>
